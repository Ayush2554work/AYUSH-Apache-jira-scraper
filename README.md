# AYUSH-Apache-jira-scraper
A Python pipeline for the Web Scraping Tutor Assignment. It creates a clean LLM corpus by extracting data from Apache Jira, intelligently using the official Jira REST API (the "smart-cut") instead of HTML scraping for a 100x more reliable and faster solution. Features include resumable state, error handling, and JSONL transformation.
